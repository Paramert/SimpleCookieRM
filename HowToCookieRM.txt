introduction, imaginary log:
 
User: open site 
site: check cookie "n"
// has cookie "n" = redirect to main.html
// has not cookie "n" = redirect to hi.html

User has not cookie "n", redirect to hi.html
User looked at the greeting or presentation and clicked on the "I'm sure" button

button: redirect to set-cookie.php
set-cookie.php: add cookie "n" to user and redirect to main.html

//the next time the user opens the site, he will immediately go to the page main.html

What is it for?

You can show the presentation and greeting once for the user. The next time the welcome page will not be opened, because the user has already seen it

You can use the file .htaccess, which is specified in the project, or use index.php with redirection to the script CRM.php
